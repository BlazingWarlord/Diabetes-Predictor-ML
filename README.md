# Diabetes-Predictor-ML
A Simple Diabetes Predictor with Scikit-Learn's Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier, hosted with Streamlit

dpd.csv is the dataset used to train the model. You may need to change the location of the CSV in the main code. This code uses some modules, including Streamlit and Scikit-Learn. You may have to install them if they haven't already been installed.

Diabetes_Predictor_LazyClassifier.py uses the LazyClassifier Module to list different Classification algorithms, with their respective accuracies and time-taken. The insights derived show that non-linear algorithms (Decision Trees, Adaboost,...) give higher accuracies.
